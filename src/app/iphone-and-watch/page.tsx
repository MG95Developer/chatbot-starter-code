          approximate distance and direction.21 To set up a group photo on your
          iPhone, join the group and use Apple Watch as a viewfinder to snap the
          shot. And when you take a call on your Apple Watch, just tap your
          iPhone to continue the conversation there.

          Looks tough. Because it is. Apple Watch Ultra 2 is crafted for
          unparalleled performance. The lightweight titanium case is rugged and
          corrosion resistant, and it&apos;s raised to protect the sapphire
          crystal from edge impacts.

         The biggest and brightest Apple Watch display ever. Powered by the all-new S9 SiP, the Alwaysâ€‘On Retina display is 3000 nits at its peak, making it even more readable in harsh sunlight. In low-light situations, it dims to 1 nit. Night Mode now activates automatically in the dark. The large display gives you room to customize your view to suit almost any activity. And a new watch face shows dynamic info like altitude, depth, or seconds along the outermost edges.
